Getting information of a specific web page (neweggs in this case) and openai to get content oriented prompt and replies from the LLM. This was done with reference and help of youtuber Don Woodlock's video [How to set up RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation (demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8tOjiYEFqU&list=LL&index=6&t=9s).
